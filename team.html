                            If working with large data-sets in digital or geospatial settings excites you, or if you want to develop your research skills in preparation for applying to PhD programs in Economics, Business, or other related fields, our work might be a good fit for you, especially if you are interested in topics around technology, entrepreneurship or innovation management.
                        </p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Since our work relies heavily on data processing and analysis, we have generally found it most productive to work with students who are extremely proficient with tools and techniques to create and analyze large datasets. These include but are not limited to python, *nix tools (e.g. working on a remote server, git etc.), R and/or Stata. Econometric training, including exposure to quasi-experimental research designs, is also preferred but not necessary.
                        </p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            If you are interested in helping us, please send us an email with the subject line "Work with us response". Please include either a short introduction or your CV, your proficiency with the tools mentioned above, and a description of the most complex data analysis/programming project you have undertaken so far. If we are too overwhelmed to take on another person or if we are not a good fit, we will let you know. If we think that we might have a productive working relationship, we will get back to you with additional questions or clarifications and likely some "trial" non-urgent tasks. If everything works out, we will schedule some time to video-chat or meet with you and discuss our ongoing work and projects and ask about your commitment. For this experience to be most useful for everyone involved, a commitment of usually 20 hours/week over at least 2 semesters or 10-12 months is necessary.
                        </p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We particularly encourage you to reach out if you feel you have very little exposure to US research or lack other connections with existing PhD students or faculty, but have the skills or desire to help. This could be true if you belong to a racial minority group, or a developing country, but there are many ways to feel under-represented or disconnected in academic research.
                        </p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                            We have found this method of working with undergraduate/master's level RAs to be mutually productive. Some have gone on to graduate programs at places like Harvard, MIT, and Berkeley, while others have presented research at conferences or gone to work in industry. We look forward to hearing from you!
