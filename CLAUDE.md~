# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a research lab website built as a static site. The project structure follows a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach for a professional academic website.

## Architecture

The website is organized as a multi-page static site with the following core pages:
- Home page (index.html) - Lab overview and introduction
- Research page - Current projects and research areas
- Team page - Lab members, faculty, and collaborators
- Publications page - Academic papers and outputs
- Contact page - Location and contact information

The site uses:
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## Development Commands

Since this is a static site, development is straightforward:
- Open `index.html` directly in browser for local preview
- Use a local server for more accurate testing: `python -m http.server 8000`
- For live reload during development, consider using Live Server extension or similar tools

## Code Organization

- Root level contains main pages (index.html, research.html, etc.)
- `/css/` directory for stylesheets
- `/js/` directory for JavaScript files
- `/images/` directory for media assets
- `/assets/` directory for downloadable resources (PDFs, papers, etc.)

## Design Patterns

- Use consistent navigation across all pages
- Maintain academic/professional visual hierarchy
- Ensure accessibility with proper semantic markup and alt text
- Keep mobile responsiveness as primary consideration
- Follow consistent naming conventions for CSS classes using BEM methodology where applicable

## Deployment

This static site can be deployed to:
- GitHub Pages (recommended for academic sites)
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Traditional web hosting

The repository is set up for easy GitHub Pages deployment from the main branch.
